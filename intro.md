# What is Bootstrap?

Taken verbatim from their [website](https://getbootstrap.com/):
>Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.

---

# In other words, it's a CSS framework of pre-written stylesheets*

#### *There is a JavaScript component to Bootstrap, too, but this presentation will only cover the CSS component

---

# Why use Bootstrap?

---
> Dave, is the site mobile responsive yet?

# Example

~~~~

    padding: 0;

    background-color: #333;
}

# Where does Boostrap fit into all of this?
- [ ] dev tool
- [x] front-end framework
- [ ] pre-processor
- [ ] language
---

# Bootstrap is *GREAT*; it isn't perfect
1. style overrides
2. verbose styles
3. some components aren't compliant with accessibility standards
4. generic design

---

# Why Bootstrap and not other libraries?
1. cross-browser compatibility
2. lightweight (CSS, at least ðŸ¤·) and easy to customize
3. responsive compoents
4. good documentation and large community
5. templates
6. grid system
