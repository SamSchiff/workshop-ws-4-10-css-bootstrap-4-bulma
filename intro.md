# What is Bootstrap?

Taken verbatim from their [website](https://getbootstrap.com/): 
>Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. 

---

# In other words, it's a CSS framework of pre-written stylesheets*

#### *There is a JavaScript component to Bootstrap, too, but this presentation is primarily concerned with CSS

# Why use Bootstrap?

> Hey, Dave â€” is the site mobile responsive yet?
