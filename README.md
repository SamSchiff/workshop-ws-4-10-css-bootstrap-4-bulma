## Bootstrapping your first website!

In this tutorial, we demonstrate the ability of bootstrap to simplify the website design process. We focus on outlining a generic webpage to emphasize the use of pre-made bootstrap components and showcase Bootstrap's intuitive nameing schemes and built-in grid system.

### Starting from scratch

The first step of creating your new webpage is easy and begins here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/
